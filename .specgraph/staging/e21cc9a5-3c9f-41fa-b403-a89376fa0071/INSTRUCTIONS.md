*   **Problem Statement:** Construction sites are chaotic, dynamic environments where equipment efficiency is lost to poor logistics. Telematics data tells you *where* a truck is, but not *what* it's doing in context of the changing terrain. This disconnect leads to "Ghost Cycles"—equipment burning fuel while waiting or taking inefficient routes—costing millions in lost productivity.
*   **Target Business Goals (KPIs):**
    *   **Utilization:** Increase effective equipment uptime by 20%.
    *   **Cost:** Reduce fuel burn by 15% via route optimization.
    *   **Safety:** Eliminate 100% of vehicle-pedestrian near-misses in geofenced zones.
*   **The "Wow" Moment:** A Site Superintendent sees a "Choke Point Alert" on the haul road map. Cortex overlays GPS tracks with Engine Load data, revealing that trucks are idling for 12 minutes at a specific intersection due to a newly placed stockpile. The system suggests a 50-meter route deviation to clear the bottleneck.
*   **Hidden Discovery:**
    *   **Discovery Statement:** "A 'Ghost Cycle' pattern (equipment moving but not hauling) is detected by correlating GPS breadcrumbs with engine load telematics, revealing a specific site layout inefficiency causing 20% fuel waste."
    *   **Surface Appearance:** Trucks are "Active" and moving; cycle times look acceptable.
    *   **Revealed Reality:** Engine load drops to idle levels during transit, indicating trucks are coasting/waiting rather than hauling payload.
    *   **Business Impact:** Redesigning the haul road saves $50k/month in fuel and improves cycle count by 15%.
